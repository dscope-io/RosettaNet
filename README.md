# RosettaNet message types, processes and samples

IC4J tool generated early preview version of RosettaNet  compatible #ICP Motoko types, available on this Github repository:  [https://github.com/dscope-io/RosettaNet/tree/master/messages/Motoko]()
RosettaNet industry standards provide business frameworks that allow individual companies to enhance the interoperability of business processes across the global supply chain.
Currently, we cover parts of 3A specification (Quotes Pricing Availability (PIP 3A1) and Purchase Orders (PIP 3A4,3A6, 3A7 ) as defined in the RosettaNet standard: [https://www.gs1us.org/resources/rosettanet]()
We plan to add more parts of the specifications and provide more samples for writing #ICP smart contracts using the generated message types. Additionally, we might generate message types for other languages used in smart contracts, such as Rust, Python, and Typescript, in the future.
